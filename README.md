# DreamCode
A coder with a dream
When I was a child, I first came into contact with computers at my cousin's house.At the time,the computer and its derivatives 
games were considered a flood and severely banned.At that time, the game machines were severely punished by the authorities.As
a child in a "law-abiding" family, we cannot do what the state does not allow us to do.Even now, that was the wrong decision.So
my impression of the computer, it's just a game machine.At that time, the game was still the age of the empire, red alert, the 
star kind of game in the present view of the picture of the tragic.But at the time, it was a rare thing for a kid who was on the 
line at two Very surprise, in high school, access to the network security, then think, what kind of software can use tools to crack,
what kind of website can handle it, can remote control other people's computer, is a special things.Unfortunately, there was no computer 
at home, so these things stayed on paper forever.I have no chance to practice myself.</p><p b> as I learn more and more, I gradually
realize that it is not a big deal to use other people's ready-made tools. It is really great to be able to make a tool by myself.So,
in line with their own writing procedures, write the idea of hanging outside.Start the code path.</p><p> arrived at the university.
With an interest in network security, I was thinking of learning software development in a systematic way.Unfortunately, 
the wrong profession is filled in.Although there are some compilation, VB and other courses in the school, but only limited to dabble in, 
cope with the test.I haven't studied that much.Later, in my junior year, I divided the specialized courses,
thinking that communication engineering could also make network, so I chose that specialized course.
and I went to my major class to find out that those courses, in fact, are mostly mathematical operations.Because of my lack of knowledge
of mathematics, I could only get by and graduate from college.</p><p> university graduate, I thought I could go to an operator.
But look at others to either 211 heavy, or to have English 46.I don't have any of these.
So I asked for a company in the software park.I went to work confused.</p><p> this company, 
say big also not big, say small also not small.It's a mobile app company.
I first entered the company's Marketing Department as a tester,
responsible for user experience testing of software.The internship period is only 1500 per month.Three months later, 
the company wanted to continue to pay me this salary. Later, the manager of our department spoke to me and the salary was slightly 
increased.1,800 a month.At first, I didn't feel anything. Later, with the increase of prices,
I gradually felt that I didn't have enough money.
But I didn't understand when I first started working.Afraid to raise wages,
to embarrass the referral.Jump ship, feel other also can't, 
afraid to go out to find a job.So he chose to suffer alone.
so, unknowingly three years passed.As the software version stabilizes, 
slowly, I have no work to do in the Marketing Department.Be idle every day.
With a passion for software development, I applied to be transferred to the r&d department, 
thinking that I could follow up with the development.However, it didn't go well at the beginning.
My colleagues were all from the department. 
I was only half way out of business and had no experience in development.Therefore, 
the manager of the r&d department asked me to take charge of operation and maintenance in the r&d department 
and deal with customers' problems.Wages will remain the same until the assessment is over.And so,
once again, with a salary of 1,800 a month, began life in the r&d department.Speaking of which,
I'd like to thank the brother who took me to the r&d department.He taught me a lot about how to deal with people in the workplace, 
and how to deal with problems, especially with customers.Let me work well and protect myself from injustice.</p><p> and that's it.
I spent almost a year in the r&d department.Due to the company's business adjustment, prepare to do the information of health system.
But by policy, tech companies are not allowed to work on medical projects.
So it was funded by the big boss and established a new company in the name of the President of our r&d department, 
responsible for the research and development of medical projects.
Since our r&d department is responsible for the specific development and implementation tasks, 
the company decided that all employees of the r&d department should work in two companies.
Two salaries.Therefore, we began to calculate the current salary level of each employee.
It was only then that they realized that I had been transferred from the inside for 1,
800 months.At that time, the internship salary of a programmer was 3000+.
That's why they decided to give me a raise.But I wanted to leave by then.
Because I really think that company is too bad.So, a year after the salary increase, 
I quit after the interest in computers.And I thought that I might earn money by writing code in the future, 
so I chose the training and went to the system to learn how to do software development.
Although there is no core algorithm involved, it is how to use the existing framework to complete the development.
But feel, oneself have a skill at least.At least you can eat a mouthful.However, the learning process is not easy.
Despite its own interest, but during the period of school, truly thought, in the years of the company is really ruined half, 
if I can come out earlier study, not only can change your life,
and the physical brain can keep up with the rhythm.As I get older, 
I sometimes react half a beat slower than my classmates, and sometimes a simple logic takes a long time to think about.Slowly, 
I began to distance myself from others.After graduating reluctantly, 
I found my present company with the help of my employment teacher.
The salary is not high, but it is much better than the previous company.
In my mind, let's go ahead and save more practical experience before we change.And so,
from now on, 
I began a new life.
although old, it is nearly 30, although sometimes I feel very tired, 
and I can't compare with the young people in the company.But I was relieved, 
at least, that I wasn't hanging out with the company and waiting to die, 
but that I had jumped out and changed my life.
Although I feel very confused about whether to continue to write code after 30 years old, 
I may not be able to go to the black website and broken software in the future.
Maybe I can't be a technical director, I can't be a CTO, I can't be an architect.
Maybe if I don't find another way, I'll only be a farmer all my life.But at least I've done what I love.
With this in mind, I still feel that I have no regrets.After the age of 30, whether you live or die,
whether you win or lose, let time examine you
